Summary

This project consists of an interactive entertainment application that combines Arduino programming with classic game elements
making use of programming paradigms such as object orientation and concepts such as concurrency and finite state machines
implemented in embedded and low-level systems. The snake moves in an environment delimited by walls and must avoid colliding 
with itself or with other players while searching for and consuming fruits that appear randomly in the matrix.
To achieve this, different components and programming techniques have been used. The snake is controlled by directional 
buttons (up, down, left, right) that the user can press to guide the snake's movement. In addition, a menu has been implemented 
for the selection of the number of players, as well as for the score display, and a musical melody to enhance the user experience.

To be taken into account:

This project was design for running in an Arduino Mega 2650. THis repository hopefully will have further updates with the skematic diagram of the electronics and all
the components necessary in order to anyone who visits this repository can recreate it.

Also, notice the documentation its already in the .cpp file. There you can consult information of the code and the information of all contributors.
